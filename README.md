### Hello!

I'm Aditya, studying Digital Media Design at UPenn in the class of 2024. I like to make Minecraft mods, watch anime, and bake bread. Check out some of my repositories:

- [eloncraft](https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/eloncraft) - a Minecraft mod to add the SpaceX Falcon 9 into the game
- [jimgus-mod](https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/jimgus-mod) - fun with procedural generation in Minecraft
- [waluig-IO](https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/waluig-IO) - a genetic algorithm to play the original Super Mario Bros
