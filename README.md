### Hello!

I'm Aditya, studying Digital Media Design at UPenn in the class of 2024. I like to make Minecraft mods, watch anime, and bake bread. Check out some of my repositories:

- [https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/eloncraft](eloncraft) - a Minecraft mod to add the SpaceX Falcon 9 into the game
- [https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/java-chess](java-chess) - pretty self-explanatory
- [https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/waluig-IO](waluig-IO) - a genetic algorithm to play the original Super Mario Bros
